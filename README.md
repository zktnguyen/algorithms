# Algorithms
Algorithms and Data Structure practice!
### Data Structures
I created the hash table, linked list, stack and binary tree data structures.

### Algorithm practice
Includes CTCI and random online judge-based challenges.  
There are multiple languages used in this repository, but this mainly includes JavaScript.  
These algorithms use my style and practice of coding.  
Some of the algorithms include comments, continuing to edit them to have all challenges include comments to clarify what is happening.
